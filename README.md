# Demo
This is my first demo 
Exp1- Cloud9 and IMA
AWS Cloud9 is an online coding tool where you can write, run, and debug code directly in your web browser, without installing anything on your computer. Allow to code from anywhere, no need for setups, collaborate with team, can run and deploy on aws services like EC2.
IAM â€“ Identity and Access Management, IAM helps you manage users, groups, and permissions so that only the right people (or applications) can use your AWS resources.

Exxp2&3- Build and Deploy
CodeBuild- AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles your source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages.
S3 (Simple Storage Service)- S3 is a cloud storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Like for backups, static website hosting, and storing application data.
CodePipeline- AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the steps of your software release process that helps you build and deploy code.
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)- Amazon EC2 provides virtual servers in the cloud to run your applications.

Exp5&6:Installation of terraform, build and destroy
Terraform is a tool used to create and manage AWS resources using code instead of doing it manually.

Exp7&8: Jenkins and SonarQube
Jenkins- Jenkins is an automation and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool. It helps automate building, testing, and deploying applications whenever developers push code changes. It ensures code is integrated frequently and delivered faster without manual steps.
SonarQube- SonarQube is a code quality and security analysis tool. It scans the source code to detect bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues.
Relation- Jenkins and SonarQube work together in a CI/CD pipeline â€” Jenkins builds and tests the code, and SonarQube checks its quality. Jenkins runs SonarQube automatically during the build to ensure only clean, bug-free code gets deployed.

Exp9&10: Nagios and NRPE
Nagios- Nagios is a monitoring tool used to check the health and performance of servers, networks, and applications.
It alerts administrators when something goes wrong (like high CPU, low disk space, or service failure). 
NRPE - NRPE is an add-on(plugin) for Nagios that allows it to run monitoring checks on remote Linux/Unix machines. It helps Nagios collect data like CPU load, memory usage, and disk status from remote systems.

Exp11: AWS lambda function
AWS Lambda runs your code automatically when something happens â€” like uploading a file or clicking a button â€” without needing any servers.
